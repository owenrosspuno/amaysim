Feature: Car Insurance Quote Calculator
    User must be able to get a quote on car insurance 
	after filling-up necessary valid data
	
Background: 	
    Given I am on car insurance quote calculator
	
Scenario Outline: User supplied valid data
    When I supplied valid "<Make>", "<Year>", "<Driver Age>", "<Gender>", "<State>", "<Email>"
        And process those data
	Then I should be able to get a quote 
	
Examples:
| Make | Year | Driver Age | Gender | State      | Email                |
| Audi | 2017 | 30         | Male   | Queensland | test0001@amaysim.com |
		
Scenario: User supplied an invalid year	
    When I supplied invalid year
    Then I should be notified that I input invalid year
	    And I cannot process those data	
		
Scenario: User supplied an invalid age	
    When I supplied invalid age
    Then I should be notified that I input invalid age
	    And I cannot process those data	
		
Scenario: User supplied invalid email address	
    When I supplied invalid email address
    Then I should be notified that I input invalid email
	    And I cannot process those data	

		
For Clarification
- User was able to input negative values in fields: Year and Age

Bug
- Get quote button was enabled even year and age button has no value

Enhancement:
- It is good idea if Age and Year can only have minimum (default) value of what is acceptable to the company
- User must not be able to press get quote button, if there are blank necessary fields
